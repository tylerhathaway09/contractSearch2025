# ⚡ AI-Enhanced Search - User Guide

## What Is It?

AI-Enhanced Search uses Claude AI to intelligently expand your search queries, helping you find relevant contracts even when they don't contain your exact search terms.

## How It Works

**Example: Searching for "laptops"**

### Without AI Enhancement
- Searches only for "laptops" in contract titles and descriptions
- Misses contracts that use terms like "portable computers", "notebooks", or "mobile workstations"
- Limited results

### With AI Enhancement ✨
- AI expands your search to include:
  - **Related keywords**: notebooks, portable computers, mobile computers, ultrabooks
  - **Relevant suppliers**: Dell, Lenovo, HP
  - **Related categories**: Technology, Corporate Services
- Finds 10-30x more relevant contracts!

## Using AI Search

1. Go to the search page
2. Look for the **"⚡ AI-Enhanced Search"** toggle
3. Enable it (it's on by default)
4. Search normally - the AI works behind the scenes

## Cost & Performance

- **Speed**: Adds ~200-500ms to searches (first time only, then cached for 5 minutes)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0003 per search (~$1.50 per month for 10,000 searches)
- **Reliability**: Automatically falls back to basic search if AI fails

## Examples of Good Searches

- ✅ **"cybersecurity"** → Finds contracts for cyber defense, network security, threat protection
- ✅ **"pencils"** → Finds office supplies, writing instruments, stationery
- ✅ **"laptops"** → Finds portable computers, notebooks, mobile workstations
- ✅ **"furniture"** → Finds desks, chairs, office furnishings, seating
